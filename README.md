# Mars-Curiosity-Rover-Image-Classification
A Comparative Evaluation of Transfer Learning, CBAM, and Autoencoder Approaches
From the outset, I was aware of the challenges I could face while trying to implement deep learning techniques on standalone systems like personal computers and laptops. The objectives that were decided upon took these limitations into consideration.
Limitations:
	Running deep learning requires a significant amount of computational capacity. 
	The performance of a neural network model developed from “scratch” can  be affected by:
	Size of training dataset : Typically, the model should be trained on millions of images to achieve best possible results. 
	Complexity of the model : The model should have extensive number of hidden layers. In other words, the model must be very deep.

Objectives: 
	Research and analyze reliable Machine learning models commonly used in computer vision and Mars imagery tasks.
	Develop reliable models on the chosen machine learning techniques.
	Create a fundamental model that achieves the most accurate results, within the constraints of the available resources.
	Perform a comparative study of the performance of the chosen models on MSL dataset.
	Analyze the outcomes to draw conclusions.
